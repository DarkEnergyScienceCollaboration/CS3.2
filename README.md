#  Methods beyand brue-force simulations

Summary -- For different DCs, different methods of enhancing resolution in the simulations can be employed,
e.g. for clusters it could be re-simulation techniques, or merger trees that serve as input for semi-analytic
models could be enhanced in resolution by approximate methods.

## Key Tasks
* Key Task CS3.2.1 ( 12/16 ): Determine which data challenges require rseolution in the simulations that cannot
be easily reached currently.
* Key Task CS3.2.2 ( 12/16 ): Document for each of these DCs alternative methods listing possible short-comings.
* Key Task CS3.2.3 ( 12/16 ): Integrate and test and evaluate approximate methods.

### Suggested organization
Repositories are available per deliverable.  Each key task has a subdirectory.
We have a `source` directory in each key task area for any supporting
code that goes with an effort.  There will also be a `doc` directory to hold documents in markdown,
latex, or binary formats.  The idea is to version everything and give us a good way to diff things.

Each deliverable is slightly different, so these repositories should grow to support the different need.

Please feel free to use github issues on each repository to organize work.
